## ABOUT

* The site is a map of all the fishing spot in NY state. It is built with React.js, Mongo and Mongoose. This is a full stack development.

## VISUAL CHOICES

* With the dataset I grabbed and re-seeded, I felt it was best to represent that data in a way that was very interactive with the user. I Chose a map that someone can use right away, giving them not only knowledge of different areas but visuals as well.

## ROADMAP

* As this is still in the production, I am working towards mapping out all the markers and then adding an event listener to each so that it may be possible to add a modal to each marker. The state of the mpa coordinates and zoom should change with each click of a marker, allowing the user to see the closer surroundings of the area chosen
