## NY-STATE-FISHING 

* Becuase I took it a step further and built this with a map, in order to see the API you must run <npm run start> in the terminal. The backend is deployed already so once run, everything will be displayed.

## ABOUT

* The site is a map of all the fishing spot in NY state. It is built with React.js, Mongo and Mongoose. You have the ability to zoom in, zoom out and drag to other areas. 

## VISUAL CHOICES

* With the dataset I grabbed and re-seeded, I felt it was best to represent that data in a way that was very interactive with the user. I Chose a map that someone can use right away, giving them not only knowledge of different areas but visuals as well.

## ROADMAP

* As this is still in the production, I am working towards adding functionality to the markers with and then adding an event listener to each so that it may be possible to add a modal to each marker. The zoom should change with each click of a marker, allowing the user to see the closer surroundings of the area chosen as well as the extra information about the chosen spot.
